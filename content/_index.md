## The Ethical Evolution of Open Source

The Open Source Definition (OSD) was written in 1998 by the Open Source Initiative to promote the adoption of software with source licensed for free use by anyone. But the emphasis of the OSD is on technical licensing requirements, which, while important, do not really define the practice of open source as experienced by millions of developers around the world over the past two decades. The true definition of open source is broader than simply licensing concerns.

In the twenty years since Christine Peterson first coined the term "open source", our community has grown astronomically, all the while learning from its successes and failures. But the political and technological landscape has also changed since the birth of this movement. Open source software today is increasingly playing a critical role in mass surveillance, anti-immigrant violence, facial recognition deployed against protestors, artificial intelligence and machine learning perpetuating discrimination, and the murder of civilians by unmanned drone attacks.

There is a growing demand from open source developers to take control of how our software is being used. We donâ€™t want our code used to aid those who commit human rights violations or other unethical behavior. We don't want our software being used to support fascist states. We don't want large corporations to take unfair advantage of our labor.

But we lack the tools to enforce fair, ethical, and community-minded terms for those who benefit from our software, and the Open Source Initiative continually undermines our efforts to develop these tools by insisting on prioritizing software freedom over human freedom.

The organizations that claim ownership of the definition of free and open source software have ignored their obligations to the community, closed their eyes to the reality of the world we live in today, and failed to address our rising concerns.

The time has come to reclaim authority over what it means to develop software in the open without compromising ourselves or the [universal values of human rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).

We are at the beginning of the era of [Ethical Source Software](/definition/).
