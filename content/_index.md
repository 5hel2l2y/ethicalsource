## An Ethical Evolution of Open Source

The Open Source Definition (OSD) was written 20 years ago by the Open Source Initiative to facilitate the adoption of software intended for free use by users, other developers, and institutions. But the emphasis of the OSD is on practical licensing requirements, which, while important, do not define the practice of open source as experienced by millions of developers around the world over the past two decades. The definition of open source is broader than simply licensing concerns.

Over time, our community developed its own working definition of open source: code that is written collaboratively in the open and intended for use and reuse by the public and our fellow developers. For two decades, the delta between the "official" definition and our more practical definition has not been a source of significant conflict.

But today is different. There is an increasing demand from open source developers to take control over how our software is being used. Many of us donâ€™t want our code used by organizations that engage in human rights violations or other unethical behavior. We also believe that the commercial entities who benefit from our labor have an obligation to give back to our community, whether through contributions to the software or through material support for the people who create and maintain the code they build their businesses on.

Historically, the open source community has not had the tools to enforce fair, ethical, and community-minded terms with those who benefit from our labor. And the Open Source Initiative with its OSD has worked against efforts to provide such tools by prioritizing software freedom over individual freedom.

The entities that claim to own the definition of what is and is not free and open source software have ignored their obligations to the community and failed to address our growing concerns. The time has come to reclaim authority over what it means to develop software in the open while not compromising on our needs and ideals as creators.

We are at the beginning of the era of [Ethical Source Software]({{< ref "definition.md" >}}).
