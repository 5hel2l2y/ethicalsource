## An Ethical Evolution of Open Source

The Open Source Definition (OSD) was created by the Open Source Initiative to facilitate the adoption of software intended for free use by other developers and institutions. But the emphasis of the OSD is on practical licensing requirements, which while important, do not define the practice of open source as experienced by millions of developers around the world. The definition of open source needs to be broader than simple licensing concerns.

Over time, the community has developed its own working definition of open source: code that is written collaboratively in public and intended for use and reuse by our fellow developers. For two decades, the delta between the official definition and the more practical definition has not been a source of significant conflict.

But today is different. There is an increasing demand from open source developers to take control over how our software is being used. For example, many of us donâ€™t want our code to support individuals and institutions that routinely engage in unethical behavior. We also believe that the commercial entities who benefit from our labor have an obligation to give back to our community, whether through contributions to the software or through material support for the people who create and maintain the code they build their businesses with.

Historically, the open source community has not had the tools to enforce fair, ethical, and community-minded applications and contributions by those who benefit from our labor. And the Open Source Initiative with its OSD has worked against efforts to provide such tools by prioritizing software freedom over individual freedom.

The entities that claim to own the definition of what is and is not free and open source software have ignored their obligations to the community and failed to address our larger concerns. The time has come to reclaim authority over what it means to develop software in the open, in a way that respects our needs and ideals as creators.

We are at the beginning of the era of [Ethical Source Software]({{< ref "definition.md" >}}).
