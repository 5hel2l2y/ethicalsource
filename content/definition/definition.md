## The Ethical Source Definition

Software is considered Ethical Source if it meets the following five criteria:

1. It is freely distributed with source code and can be combined or used in conjunction with other software without a royalty or fee.
2. It is developed in public and has a process for accepting community contributions.
3. Its community is governed by a code of conduct that is consistently and fairly enforced.
4. Its creators have the right to prohibit its use by individuals or institutions engaged in human rights violations or other practices they deem unethical.
5. Its creators can solicit reasonable and voluntary compensation from the communities or institutions that benefit from the software.

The Ethical Source Definition is a living document. The Ethical Source community at large owns this definition and may improve and evolve it by contributing issues and revisions in [our Github repository](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/ethicalsource "Ethical Source Definition source code").
